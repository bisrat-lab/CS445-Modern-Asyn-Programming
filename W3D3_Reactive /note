Reactive Programming
Reactive Programming in JavaScript is like a sequence of events that occur in time. ... It is a programming of event streams that happens in time. RxJS is a JavaScript library for transforming, composing and querying asynchronous streams of data.

Observables: wrapper of same data source
Subscriptions: connection of The "listening" to the stream 
Observers:is used to execuite some code when ther is a value,
==>next()whenver call next method we are adding value to stream
==>error()
==>complete()


==>A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time
==>It can emit
three different things: a value (of some type), an error, or a completed
signal.

==>The "listening" to the stream is called subscribing.
==>The functions we are
defining are observers.
